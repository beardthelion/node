# one argv spelling: any step whose code pairs a tag-pushing mechanism
# (imagetools create, docker push, a build-push-action tags: input, crane,
# regctl, skopeo, oras) with a mutable-tag reference (latest or MAJOR_MINOR)
# is a carrier, and exactly one may exist (the step named "Move floating
# tags"), gated on both the event and the ref. Matching on code text with
# comments stripped keeps a comment quoting either pattern from counting.
# The guard must sit on the step's if: line as a single && condition, so an
# ||-weakened or comment-borne condition cannot satisfy it. The carrier must
# also bound the move against live state: a re-run of an older push run
# replays stored outputs under the original event and ref, so the step must
# read the releases list and refuse (exit 1) rather than move the tags
# backward. No step may read the retired packages/container endpoint at all.

# Once a job's resolver step (id: rel) has run, nothing downstream may read
# needs.release-please.outputs.version/tag_name: the resolver is the boundary
# that proved the tag, and a second derivation of the same value can drift
# from what was verified. Every line of every step is scanned (including the
# - name:/if: line, where the first-line skip used to hide a read), every
# job-level line is scanned (an env: read there feeds all steps), and every
# job is in scope (a read in a job with no rel step is equally unverified).
# The only exemption is the rel step itself, which reads tag_name as its
# RELEASE_TAG input.
